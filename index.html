                        <p>Where should you go when the whole world seems to be against you? Social Company from Cologne have found their own answer to this hopelessness with their debut EP. In times of a global pandemic, worldwide crises and the disorientation of an entire generation, “Lakehouse Sessions'' is a musical manifesto by three people who finally want to feel good again. The trio embarks on the escape to the front in five varied and thrillingly real songs, which cut their way through the mountain of social and personal burdens with summary surf rock, encouraging funk and melancholy sun pop. The result is an impressively varied and multi-layered EP, to which Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ocean Alley and Jason Mraz would nod in appreciation.</p>
                        <p>The story of Social Company begins in early 2021. At this point in time, nobody really knows where to go. After a year of Corona, all power reserves are used up. Climate change has only disappeared from the media, not from the world. And those who are looking for their own place in society at the moment are faced with far too many closed doors. At this time, the two friends Jan and Chris are often together and, without really wanting to, lay the foundation for what will later become a social company. Both have known each other for many years from school and other band projects. "When two musicians are related to each other, then it is probably only natural that songs end up in the end," says singer Jan, recalling the beginnings of the project. "We noticed relatively quickly that it worked well and that we complement each other well."</p>
                        <p>After the band had only existed as a duo for a few weeks, Social Company suddenly got the offer in March 2021 to play in front of hundreds of people at Fridays for Future on the occasion of the global climate strike. On the occasion of the performance, the band rehearsed for the first time that same week with drummer Corny, whom Chris and Jan also know from school and their time together with the alternative punks Another Optimism and who has been an integral part of the project ever since. The fact that Social Company makes their first appearance at Fridays for Future is symbolic of what the trio embodies in every pore. The band puts a bit of hope in the face of even the deepest crises and even in the darkest of times still finds the light that their music needs as well as the people behind it.</p>
                        <p>The EP “Lakehouse Sessions” is the first studio project by Social Company and proves to be an impressively multi-layered EP, which represents everything this trio is across numerous levels in just five songs. The band wrote the record during a wonderful summer week in a house on the lake in Eutin, northern Germany, a domicile that gave the trio the seclusion to concentrate on the essentials of their art, away from any Weltschmerz. “During the heyday of the pandemic, this house was the positive corner that we forced ourselves into to write this record,” is how the band describes the atmosphere in which the songs could mature. “Only then could the EP become so special. Making music is so easy without distraction. We needed this relaxed approach to let the music live. "
