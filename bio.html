                    <p>Love life, love yourself. "Good Life" is the first studio album of the band Social Company from Cologne, an emotional journey in search of anchoring in life and one's own place in society in the face of the climate catastrophe, global crisis and ruthless capitalism. The four musicians deliver ten new songs on the album, which stylistically move between punk, alternative rock, indie and pop. Compared to the previous EP "Lakehouse Sessions", the musical range is again significantly increased. Between soft piano solos, radiant trumpet sounds and groovy riffs, each song offers a unique experience. The album "Good Life" is a guarantee for adrenaline and endorphins. It is the second studio project of Social Company. 

                    In 2021, Social Company played their first gig at the Fridays for Future global climate strike in front of 500 people. Since then, the stages have grown. In addition to shows in and around Cologne, the band was able to prove itself in 2022 as the opening band of Kaffkiez at the JuWi-Fest in Münster and played its first gig abroad, in the German-speaking part of Belgium. 
                    Social Company makes unique music for everyone and is convincing with energetic music and passionate performances. They bring the good life to every stage.</p>
